        <p>This is an automatically generated email reminder:</p>
        <p>
            Your goods are ready for delivery / pick-up - but we have not yet<br />
            registred, that the payment can be accepted - therefore we are<br />
            sending a you a new link to the credit card invoice system<br />
            <br />
            <a href="{{invoice.link}}">{{invoice.link}}</a><br />
        </p>
        <p>
            When entering your credit card information, - errors may occure<br />
            preventing us from noticing the payment - thus causing unnecessary<br />
            delays - therefore we include the following notice.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is very helpful and results in a shorter expedite time - if you could<br />
            please send us an email when the payment is made.
        </p>
        <p>
             We would also welcome an email or phone call - if you:<br />
             * Experiencing problems with our payment system<br />
             * Wish to cancel the order<br />
             * Wish to change the order<br />
             * Wish to pay by other means - for example, by transfering the amount via home banking.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kind regards<br />
